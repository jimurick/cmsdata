# Stars - Hospital Data

The data here is taken from the [Care compare reports](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/archived-data/hospitals) and CMS's [SAS Package](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/sas) for calculating hospital star ratings.

The numbered Rmarkdown (Rmd) notebooks download the quarterly archives, and then collect data from most measures recorded since 2015. The fifth notebook, `05_sas_data_for_package.Rmd`, has the data used in my [hospitalstars R package](https://github.com/jimurick/hospitalstars)
